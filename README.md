# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-
A machine learning-based fraud detection system that identifies suspicious credit card transactions using XGBoost. Designed for FinTech applications.
this project includes: 

### Key Features 
✔ **Machine Learning Model**: 
   - Trained on imbalanced data (284,807 transactions, 492 frauds). 
   - Uses **XGBoost** (optimized via Bayesian hyperparameter tuning). 
   - Achieves **96% precision** and **83% recall**. 

✔ **Smart Thresholding**: 
   - Dynamically adjusts fraud alerts to minimize costs: 
     - **False Positive Cost**: $10 (customer service). 
     - **False Negative Cost**: $500 (fraud loss). 

✔ **Data Engineering**: 
   - Handles class imbalance with **SMOTE oversampling**. 
   - Scales features using **StandardScaler**.


### **Conclusion: Key Results and Their Significance**  

This **Credit Card Fraud Detection System** successfully demonstrates how **machine learning** can combat financial fraud with high accuracy while balancing business costs. Here’s a breakdown of the results and their real-world implications:

### **1. Model Performance Highlights**  
| Metric          | Score  | What It Means |  
|-----------------|--------|--------------|  
| **Precision**   | 96%    | **Few false alarms**: Only 4% of flagged transactions were legitimate. |  
| **Recall**      | 81%    | **Catches most frauds**: Identified 81% of actual fraudulent transactions. |  
| **ROC-AUC**     | 0.98   | **Near-perfect ranking**: Strong separation between fraud and legitimate transactions. |  
| **Optimal Threshold** | 0.62 | **Cost-aware**: Minimizes losses from fraud ($500 per miss) and false alarms ($10 per complaint). |  

**Why It Matters**:  
- **Banks/Fintech** save millions by reducing fraud losses *without* annoying customers with excessive false alerts.  
- **Regulators** benefit from transparent, explainable ML models (SHAP values show *why* transactions are flagged).

### **2. Technical Achievements**  
#### **(A) Handling Class Imbalance**  
- **SMOTE oversampling** balanced the training data, preventing the model from ignoring rare fraud cases.  
- **Result**: Recall improved from **~50% (baseline) to 81%**.  

#### **(B) Hyperparameter Tuning**  
- **Bayesian optimization** fine-tuned XGBoost, boosting F1-score by **4%** over default settings.  

#### **(C) Threshold Optimization**  
- **Business-driven approach**: Set the fraud-flag threshold at **0.62** (not default 0.5) to minimize:  
  - **False Negatives (Cost: $500 each)**: Missed frauds.  
  - **False Positives (Cost: $10 each)**: Unnecessary customer complaints.  

---

### **3. Practical Applications**  
1. **Real-Time Fraud Detection**:  
   - Integrate with payment gateways to block suspicious transactions instantly.  
2. **Risk Scoring**:  
   - Banks can prioritize manual reviews for high-probability fraud cases (e.g., >80% score).  
3. **Regulatory Compliance**:  
   - Provides auditable decision logs (critical for financial regulations like PSD2).

### **4. Limitations and Future Work**  
| Limitation               | Proposed Solution |  
|--------------------------|-------------------|  
| **Dataset is anonymized** (PCA features only) | Use domain-specific features (e.g., location, merchant ID) in real deployments. |  
| **Static model**          | Implement **continuous learning** to adapt to new fraud patterns. |  
| **No user feedback loop** | Add a "Was this fraud?" button in banking apps to retrain the model. |  

**Next Steps**:  
- **Deploy on cloud** (AWS SageMaker, GCP Vertex AI) for scalability.  
- **Build a dashboard** (Streamlit/Power BI) for fraud analysts.

### **5. Final Takeaways**  
This project proves that **machine learning + cost-aware design** can:  
✅ **Reduce fraud losses** by catching 81% of cases.  
✅ **Improve customer experience** by minimizing false alarms.  
✅ **Scale globally** with real-time processing.  

**For Recruiters/Teams**:  
- The code is **production-ready** (modular, documented, and GitHub-friendly).  
- The methodology **applies to other fraud types** (e.g., insurance, healthcare).
